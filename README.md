### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I am a fresh graduate of Life Science (spec. Biomedical Sciences) from the National University of Singapore. After dabbling in RNA-seq analysis during my honours thesis, I realized my budding interest in bioinformatics. I aspire to work with omics data and their integration to derive meaningful insights for personalized medicine!
